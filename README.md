# Capstone



    1. This is a collaborative NYCDSA capstone project done with Charlie Zien.

    2. It involves that analyses of New York City Airbnb data using machine learning and geospatial modeling.

    3. The data was taken from Inside Airbnb (not affiliated with the Airbnb company): 
    http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html (go to the New York city section).

    4. For the sake of completeness, the CSV data that was employed in this work has been uploaded here. 
    If you are looking at this page after September 2019, you may want to visit Inside Airbnb and get 
    the latest data.

    5. The PDF file contains all the necessary details (e.g. source of data; modeling schemes, etc.)

    6. The Jupyter notebooks contains all the details of the python scripts, ranging from the data cleaning 
    and missing data imputation process to the machine learning model. There are two notebooks: one with 25 
    features (small) and another with 51 features (large). The PDF presentation was based on the large 
    data set.

    7.The geospatial modeling portion of the work was done elsewhere using arcgis.
